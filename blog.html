        <h1>What is the difference between var let const?</h1>
    <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.</p>
    <h1>What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?</h1>
    <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
    <h1>what is the difference between map and foreach?</h1>
    <p>The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by applying the callback function on each element of an array, while the forEach method doesn't return anything. You can use the forEach method to mutate the source array, but this isn't really the way it's meant to be used.</p>
    <h1>why we use temple string in javacript?</h1>
    <p>Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is called string interpolation.</p>
